A project was launched to explore the impact of ChatGPT on Wikipedia's AI-related content, focusing on changes in page views, edits, and contributor activity. The study period was divided into control (Nov-Dec 2021) and treatment (Nov-Dec 2022) phases for comparison. A Python-based pipeline was developed to collect relevant data from Wikipedia's API, targeting AI category topics. Statistical analysis was performed to detect shifts in traffic and engagement, using Python's Pandas and PowerBI for data handling. PowerBI was also employed to create interactive dashboards, illustrating trends through overtime line charts. The findings indicated a decrease in Wikipedia page views following ChatGPT's release, while the frequency of page revisions remained unchanged, highlighting ChatGPT's influence on information consumption without affecting content updates.
